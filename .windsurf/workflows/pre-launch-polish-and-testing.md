CREATE WORKFLOW: "Pre-Launch Polish & Testing (Phase 4)"

I want to save this as a workflow that systematically polishes the entire app for launch by fixing bugs, adding loading states, improving error handling, optimizing performance, and ensuring a professional user experience throughout.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

WORKFLOW NAME: Pre-Launch Polish & Testing

DESCRIPTION:
Comprehensive polish pass covering: loading states, error handling, empty states, responsive design, performance optimization, accessibility basics, edge case handling, and end-to-end testing of all critical user flows.

[See user-provided workflow text for the full checklist of tasks (1–20) across loading states, skeletons, error handling, validation, empty states, optimistic updates, image optimization, button states, touch targets, confirmations, toasts, responsive design, accessibility, offline handling, slow-operation loaders, console cleanup, performance audit, real-device testing, and final launch checklist.]
